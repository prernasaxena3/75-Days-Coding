/*Manasa is out on a hike with friends. She finds a trail of stones with numbers on them. She starts following the trail and notices that any two consecutive stonesâ€™ numbers differ by one of two values. Legend has it that there is a treasure trove at the end of the trail. If Manasa can guess the value of the last stone, the treasure will be hers.

Example

n = 2
a = 2
b = 3

She finds  stones and their differences are a = 2 or b = 3. We know she starts with a 0 stone not included in her count. The permutations of differences for the two stones are [2, 2], [2, 3], [3, 2] or [3, 3]. Looking at each scenario, stones might have [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 5] or [3, 6] on them. The last stone might have any of 4, 5 or 6 on its face.

Compute all possible numbers that might occur on the last stone given a starting stone with a 0 on it, a number of additional stones found, and the possible differences between consecutive stones. Order the list ascending.*/

/*QUESTION 2: A driver is driving on the freeway. The check engine light of his vehicle is on, and the driver wants to get service immediately. Luckily, a service lane runs parallel to the highway. It varies in width along its length.

You will be given an array of widths at points along the road (indices), then a list of the indices of entry and exit points. Considering each entry and exit point pair, calculate the maximum size vehicle that can travel that segment of the service lane safely.

Example

n = 4
width = [2, 3, 2, 1]
cases = [[1, 2], [2, 4]]

If the entry index, i = 1 and the exit, j = 2, there are two segment widths of 2 and 3 respectively. The widest vehicle that can fit through both is 2. If i = 2 and j = 4, the widths are [3, 2, 1] which limits vehicle width to 1.*/
